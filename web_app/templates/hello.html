    <h1>{{ message }}</h1>

    <p>Hello there. Welcome to my website. Here you will find a home page, an about page, and a weather forcast page.
        The last one is the most exciting, because you can input your country code, like US, and then your zip code, and you'll get the weather for this location.
        Go check it out! 
    </p>
